# TIC ana-dig comparison

## Analog

**Advantages** :

* Less equipment is needed
* Already in use on MSF missions

**Disadvantages** :

* The analog signal is more sensitive to noise
* Audio quality can be reduced due to interferences
* Limited to vocal communications (no text, position reports, etc.)
* No point to pont calls (always broadcast or on a "private" channel)

## Digital

**Advantages** :

* Audio signal is less sensitive to noise and interferences
* Used for vocal, but can also transmit text, position reports, etc.
* Can be used for point to point and/or group communications thanks to the radio IDs
* Data (position, metrics, ...) can automatically be sent or requested

**Disadvantages** :

* Extra equipment & training needed for data handling (radio interface, computer to show data, etc.)
* New firmwares and profiles are needed to use the new features
